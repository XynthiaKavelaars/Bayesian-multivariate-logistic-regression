Warning: This simulation takes a long time to run (a few months over multiple cores) and requires a lot of memory!

These scripts are based on parallel computation. The default number of cores is set at the number of cores of the PC minus one. 
To change the number of cores, change parameter(s) "nCores" in "\Simulation\SampleParameters.R" and "\Application\SampleParameters.R".
